Projects I create with friends that help make life better in some way

Project Scutum 
- Uses accelerometer from cell phone and/or smartwatch to detect unusual jumps in the user's driving pattern to then geotag potential pothole coordinates for municipalities to recieve and send response crews to repair
-Questions : Language(s) best suited to tackle this , would access to car OS be a better way to get vibration data ? , how much would that data cost? , would car companies be willing for outside contribution ? 

Project Pictor
- Storymaking website and/or app that allows users to connect how real life plot points are connected between people including backstories 
- Allows users to Answer what are the 1000 words in a picture and connect those pictures graphically and with passages 
- Questions : Practicality? and Languages best suited to tackle this
